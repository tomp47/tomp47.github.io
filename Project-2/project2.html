        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>I am a current student at the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/"> University of Colorado Boulder</a>, studying Creative Technology and Design through the school of Engineering. Being from New Jersey, I grew up surfing, golfing, and playing hockey. I enjoy being outside as much as possible, while also being active. A main aspect of my life is traveling, which has mostly been road trips, and frequents visits to Mexico. </p>  

        <p> I took a gap year in 2020 after graduating highschool. During this year, I moved to vail for the 2020-2021 ski season. I lived with three Serbain men, who I quickly became very close with. I worked at the <a href="https://www.salomon.com"> Salomon </a> ski shop, as well as Nazawa sushi. I was on the mountain more then 100 days and made memories I will never forget. For more about my gap year, visit my "gap year" tab.</p>
